<h2> Making memes </h2>
<p>I make memes primarily for my own enjoyment, and for fun. I do not share them online yet. I am thinking of making my own meme page and making its name something super dank, Like grandmas salad 73, or dog breath memes. In the end memes ar overall a lot of fun to use templates and make them personalized.<img src="https://quizizz.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115002501069/1024x1024.jpg" alt="One of my favorite meme templates to use" style="width:307px;"></p>

    <h2> Viewing memes</h2>
    <p> I really do enjoy viewing memes, whether it be on Reddit, or Tumbler, Instagram, or Ifunny. In General all of these media cites for viewing memes have similar memes, except that they have slight differences. On instagram you find a lot of stolen memes, and also a lot of really dark and morbid memes. while on tumbler you'll find memes that are more based on the wit, and crazyness of peple that is humorous. <img src="https://pics.me.me/when-your-friend-says-he-gets-his-memes-from-ifunny-22036000.png" alt="just a solid meme from Ifunny" style="width:693px;"></p>

    <h2>Stealing memes, and Copyright</h2>
    <p>It has long been said that memes are a lawless world. That statement is both true and false. It is true in the sense that people will steal any meme from anyone and not give any credit. However it is deeply frowned upon the meme community to steal memes, or to feature a meme and not give any credit. <img src="https://pics.me.me/searching-for-stolen-memes-4265804.png" alt="A stolen meme about stealing memes" style="width:307px;"></p>
