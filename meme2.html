<h2> Mondays and Tuesdays </h2>
<p>Mondays I just show up to school with my workout clothes, and a change of clothes. After all of my classes I go to weight lifting immiediatly after school, at Spartan Hall. While weight lifting with the soccer team we do glute bridges, deadlifts, benchpress, and other types of lifts. After the hour of lifting weights, I change, and go to the robotics room. I spend another hour doing robotics, before getting a ride home.<img src="https://yorkbarbell.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2900_300LBStandardOlympicSet-600x346.jpg" alt="Just some weights" style="width:307px;"></p>

    <h2> Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays</h2>
    <p>On Wednesdays I only have robotics after school, so that is all I plan for. Then on thursdays I have to get ready for 2 soccer practices. first there is the High school soccer team, we practice after school, and go for 2 hours. We do a lot of finishing and fitness. Then I wait until 6, where my sister comes to damien, picks me up, and then takes me to my other practice, where we go for 2 hours. On Fridays I have to usually work for sports Medicine, so I leave around 5:30.  <img src="https://cdn7.bigcommerce.com/s-i2qcqby6e2/images/stencil/500x659/products/2800/6505/5dff56ea__Nike-Mercurial-Superfly-6-Pro-CR7-Dynamic-Fit-Firm-Ground-Soccer-Cleats-Green-Black__37194.1524239213.jpg?c=2&imbypass=on" alt="my pair of cleats" style="width:693px;"></p>

    <h2>Saturday and Sunday</h2>
    <p>On the weekend I have 4 things, Soccer, Homework, Chores, and Robotics. For soccer I usually have one game per weekend, and it may require a lot of traveling to get there. I allways have homework to be done, and chores just never end. For robotics, I have to go to league, or a tournament, depending on the day. At the competition, we compete against other vex robotics teams.<img src="https://www.vexrobotics.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/v/r/vrc-fullfieldkit.png" alt="the current vex robotics game" style="width:307px;"></p>
